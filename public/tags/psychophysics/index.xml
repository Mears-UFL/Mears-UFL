      <description>This semester students will gain hands-on experience in the techniques and procedures of perceptual psychophysics and psychology research. Activities in the lab will challenge students to think carefully and critically about every aspect of the research process in order to understand benefits and limitations of the scientific method in psychological research. After completing a progression of small assignments involving data manipulation, students conduct instructor-supervised group projects to replicate a previously published sensory processes experiment Designing and conducting their replication experiment, students will collect behavioral data, and grapple with producing tables, visualizations, and inferential statistics in order to compare data with experimental results from the original research.</description>
