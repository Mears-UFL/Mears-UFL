      <description>Conscious awareness is a hallmark of human experience. In this class we will consider cutting edge research of brain mechanisms and neural signs as we discuss abnormal, altered, disrupted, and non-human consciousness. As a result of this class, we will have a better understanding of the potential function of consciousness and be able to differentiate conscious from unconscious processes.
Relevant topics will include:
&amp;#8226; anesthesia &amp;#8226; coma &amp;#8226; dreams
&amp;#8226; free-will &amp;#8226; hallucinations</description>

      <description>Much work has been done to explore sensory gating in human and animal subjects, yet fewer efforts have been made to apply a rigorous framework to translate findings in preclinical and clinical investigations of sensory gating. A significant obstacle to comparison is the number of the systems of the brain that display sensory gating. Initial discovery of sensory gating of event-related potentials (ERP) in humans corresponded to generators in auditory cortex.</description>
