      <description>Much work has been done to explore sensory gating in human and animal subjects, yet fewer efforts have been made to apply a rigorous framework to translate findings in preclinical and clinical investigations of sensory gating. A significant obstacle to comparison is the number of the systems of the brain that display sensory gating. Initial discovery of sensory gating of event-related potentials (ERP) in humans corresponded to generators in auditory cortex.</description>
