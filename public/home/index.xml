      <description>Teaching My teaching goals are to help students to develop skills, knowledge frameworks, and quantitative and scientific literacy that will be useful in their future careers.
 What is the difference between merely knowing (or remembering, or memorizing) and understanding? â€¦ A thing or idea seems meaningful only when we have several different ways to represent itâ€“different perspectives and different associations. Then we can turn it around in our minds&amp;hellip;1</description>

      <description>Conscious awareness, a hallmark of human experience, is like the exposed tip-of-the-iceberg compared to the concealed, unconscious processes of the brain. In this class we will consider cutting edge research of brain mechanisms and neural signs as we discuss abnormal, altered, disrupted, and non-human consciousness. As a result of this class, we will have a better understanding of the potential function of consciousness and be able to differentiate conscious from unconscious processes.</description>

      <description>This course is an introductory survey of the human senses and their role in perception. A goal of this course is to appreciate that our sensorium receives something different from our resultant awareness and reactions to the world around us. Distributed over and throughout the body, diverse physical sensor arrays receive and transduce signals into neural information. In the pathways of the brain, expansive and hierarchical decoding processes follow the initial sensory encoding.</description>

      <description>This semester students will gain hands-on experience in the techniques and procedures of perceptual psychophysics and psychology research. Activities in the lab will challenge students to think carefully and critically about every aspect of the research process in order to understand benefits and limitations of the scientific method in psychological research. After completing a progression of small assignments involving data manipulation, students conduct instructor-supervised group projects to replicate a previously published sensory processes experiment Designing and conducting their replication experiment, students will collect behavioral data, and grapple with producing tables, visualizations, and inferential statistics in order to compare data with experimental results from the original research.</description>
