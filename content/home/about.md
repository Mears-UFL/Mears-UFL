My objective is to help students to develop skills, knowledge frameworks, and quantitative and scientific literacy that will be useful in their future careers. These abilities will enable students to address complex issues effectively and to develop abilities to ask meaningful questions that help solve important scientific problems.  

> What is the difference between merely knowing (or remembering, or memorizing) and understanding? … A thing or idea seems meaningful only when we have several different ways to represent it–different perspectives and different associations. Then we can turn it around in our minds...[^1]

Sensory-perceptual neuroscience requires one to rediscover and to reframe the constraints and features of one's own perceptual reality. Experiencing sensory-perceptual phenomena while learning neurobiology and neurophysiology of these phenomena will allow neuroscience students to understand the brain circuitry, systems, and dynamic mechanisms of sensory-perceptual phenomena. Metaperceptual knowledge leads to development of a neurobiological self-concept and self-understanding.
