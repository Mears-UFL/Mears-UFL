My objective is to help students to develop skills, knowledge frameworks, and quantitative and scientific literacy that will be useful in their future careers. I strive to encourage students' self-confidence to address complex issues effectively and to develop abilities to ask meaningful questions that help solve important scientific problems.

Learning perceptual neuroscience encompasses a wide range of benefits including science literacy and self-insight. Some threshold concepts in sensory-perceptual neuroscience require one to rediscover and reframe the subtle capabilities, constraints, and features of one's own perceptual reality. Experiencing sensory-perceptual phenomena while learning neurobiology and neurophysiology of the phenomena will allow neuroscience students to understand the brain circuitry, systems, and dynamic mechanisms of sensory-perceptual phenomena. Truly understanding enables development of a neurobiological self-concept and self-understanding.
