## Teaching

My teaching goals are to help students to develop skills, knowledge frameworks, and quantitative and scientific literacy that will be useful in their future careers.

The neuroscience of perception encompasses a wide range of topics including science literacy and self-insight. It's necessary and essential to experience sensory-perceptual phenomena in order to understand and apply neuroscience concepts. Understanding the neurobiology, neural circuitry, neural systems, and neurophysiological dynamics that inherently constitute sensory-perceptual phenomena, allows one to gain unique self-understanding of their own perceptual realities in addition to many of the less obvious features, constraints, and capabilities.  My objective is to encourage self-confidence to address complex issues effectively and to develop the ability to ask meaningful questions that help solve important scientific problems.

## Research

Psychology courses that I teach approach sensation, perception, emotional and/or cognitive function from the vantage of clinical neuroscience and aspects of prefrontal cortex physiology. During my research career, a central focus has been to investigate the functional role of the mammalian prefrontal cortex to maintain healthy and flexible emotional learning. These investigations addressed translational neuroscience research questions and utilized neuroscience techniques that are able to span levels of analysis from mesoscopic to macroscopic neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. During adulthood, neuroplasticity takes place on timescales that are longer than days to weeks but shorter than years. The neuroscience of the interplay of trauma, stress, and neuroplasticity has potential to help understand the causes of some mental health dysfunctions and explain the effects of some promising new treatments.
