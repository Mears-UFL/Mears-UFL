> We must train a new generation of neuroscientists that are question driven and not technique limited. This generation should be prepared to take full advantage of data from multiple sources and levels of analysis to address their research hypotheses. 
>The first and most important step in achieving this goal is to conceive of training as centered around questions rather than techniques or levels of analysis.
