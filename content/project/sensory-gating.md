Much work has been done to explore sensory gating in human and animal subjects, yet fewer efforts have been made to apply a rigorous framework to translate findings in preclinical and clinical investigations of sensory gating. A significant obstacle to comparison is the number of the systems of the brain that display sensory gating. Initial discovery of sensory gating of event-related potentials (ERP) in humans corresponded to generators in auditory cortex. However, in the animal model, much research focused solely on the limbic system and the thalamus of the rat and mouse.  During my early career, we investigated and expanded the known network of sensory gating structures, elucidating activity in rat prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. 

This translational framework to compare sensory gating in human and animal subjects required several types of information. An important caveat for a majority of clinical investigation of sensory gating in humans is that the only source of scalp ERPs with sufficient signal to noise fidelity are the ERP generators of the auditory cortex. Sensory gating in numerous neuroanatomical structures require invasive measurement. The invasive approach provides detailed information on the local-circuit components of each brain region. In an invasive intracranial investigation of human hippocampus (Boutros, Mears et al, 2007), we compared our results with prior research of sensory gating in rodent hippocampus.
