abstract = "The striatum is thought to be an essential region for integrating diverse information in the brain. Rapid inhibitory gating (IG) of sensory input is most likely an early factor necessary for appropriate integration to be completed. Gating is currently evaluated in clinical settings and is dramatically altered in a variety of psychiatric illnesses. Basic neuroscience research using animals has revealed specific neural sites involved in IG including the hippocampus, thalamus, brainstem, amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex. The present study investigated local IG in the basal ganglia structure of the striatum using chronic recording microwires. We obtained both single unit activations and local field potentials (LFPs) in awake behaving rats from each wire during the standard two-tone paradigm. Single units responded with different types of activations including a phasic and sustained excitation, an inhibitory response and a combination response that contained both excitatory and inhibitory components. IG was observed in all the response types; however, non-gating was observed in a large proportion of responses as well. Positive wave field potentials at 50â€“60 ms post-stimulus (P60) showed consistent gating across the wire arrays. No significant correlations were found between single unit and LFP measures of gating during the initial baseline session. Gating was strengthened (Tamp/Camp ratios approaching 0) following acute stress (saline injection) at both the single unit and LFP level due to the reduction in the response to the second tone. Alterations in sensory responding reflected by changes in the neural response to the initial tone were primarily observed following long-term internal state deviation (food deprivation) and during general locomotion. Overall, our results support local IG by single neurons in striatum but also suggest that rapid inhibition is not the dominant activation profile observed in other brain regions."
abstract_short = "The present data show that striatal cells do respond to auditory information and display IG of this sensory input. IG in this neural subregion is more sparse in terms of the percentage of sensory responsive cells that gate compared with other structures that have been investigated such as the medial prefrontal cortex (Mears et al., 2006) and amygdala (Cromwell et al., 2005a)."

caption = "Examples of non-gated responses in the striatum. The same response types were identified in similar subareas of the striatum that did not display substantial inhibition between the tones. (A) E-SD subtype that shows similar responses to the two tones. (B) An E-LD that is similar between the two tone stimuli and (C) displays an InH that does not show gating. (D) A combination response that persists in responding for the 100 trials in a consistent manner between tones 1 and 2."
