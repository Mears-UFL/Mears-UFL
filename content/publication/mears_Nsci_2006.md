abstract = "Medial prefrontal cortex is a crucial region involved in inhibitory processes. Damage to the medial prefrontal cortex can lead to loss of normal inhibitory control over motor, sen- sory, emotional and cognitive functions. The goal of the present study was to examine the basic properties of inhibitory gating in this brain region in rats. Inhibitory gating has recently been proposed as a neurophysiological assay for sensory filters in higher brain regions that potentially enable or disable informa- tion throughput. This perspective has important clinical rele- vance due to the findings that gating is dramatically impaired in individuals with emotional and cognitive impairments (i.e. schizophrenia). We used the standard inhibitory gating two- tone paradigm with a 500 ms interval between tones and a 10 s interval between tone pairs. We recorded both single unit and local field potentials from chronic microwire arrays implanted in the medial prefrontal cortex. We investigated short-term (within session) and long-term (between session) variability of auditory gating and additionally examined how altering the interval be- tween the tones influenced the potency of the inhibition. The local field potentials displayed greater variability with a reduc- tion in the amplitudes of the tone responses over both the short and long-term time windows. The decrease across sessions was most intense for the second tone response (test tone) leading to a more robust gating (lower T/C ratio). Surprisingly, single unit responses of different varieties retained similar lev- els of auditory responsiveness and inhibition in both the short and long-term analysis. Neural inhibition decreased monotoni- cally related to the increase in intertone interval. This change in gating was most consistent in the local field potentials. Subsets of single unit responses did not show the lack of inhibition even for the longer intertone intervals tested (4 s interval). These findings support the idea that the medial prefrontal cortex is an important site where early inhibitory functions reside and po- tentially mediate psychological processes. "

abstract_short = "The results of the present study provide direct support for mPFC in sensory IG and show that the inhibition can persist over an extended period at both the LFP and single unit level."

caption = "Results for LFP from four CTIs of separation are indicated on the right-side axis for cAmp and tAmp (microvolts). The left-side axis marks T/C ratios for each CTI. S.E.M. markers are shown for all data. Although, T/C ratios increase monotonically with increasing CTIs, the relationship is not necessarily linear."
