abstract = "Inhibitory gating (IG) is a basic central nervous system process for filtering repetitive sensory information. Although IG deficits coincide with cognitive and emotional dysfunction in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, limited research has been completed on the basic, functional nature of IG. Persistent IG occurs in rat prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a crucial site for modulating emotional learning. To investigate the interaction of affect and IG, we recorded local field potentials (LFP) directly from prelimbic mPFC and examined the influence of tone-shock fear conditioning (FC) on IG. Behavioral reactions during IG were observed before and after FC, and increase of orienting response after FC indicated induction of tone-shock association. After FC, some components of LFP response exhibited short-term weakening of IG. On a subsequent day of recording, IG strengthened for all LFP components, but individual components differed in their particular changes. Affective regulation of IG represents an important factor influencing within-subject IG variability, and these results have implications for understanding the role of rapid, implicit neural coding involved in emotional learning and affective disruption in psychiatric disease."

caption = "Side-by-side presentation of session marginal means (with SE whiskers) for cAmp, tAmp (bars), and T/C (lines) clearly indicate that change of P1 and P2 tAmp brings about T/C change across sessions. P1 tAmp and T/C ratios increased after fear conditioning and decreased in the extinction session. N1 marginal means indicate that increased cAmp mediates the decrease of T/C ratio in the extinction session. P2 marginal means clearly show that tAmp determines the T/C effects of fear conditioning and extinction."
