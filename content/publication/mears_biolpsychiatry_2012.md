abstract = "**Background**: Disrupted neuroplasticity may be an important aspect of the neural basis of schizophrenia. We used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to assay neuroplasticity after auditory conditioning in chronic schizophrenia patients (SZ) and matched healthy control subjects (HC).**Methods**: Subjects (15 HC, 14 SZ) performed an auditory oddball task during electroencephalogram recording before and after auditory tetanic stimulation (Pre/Post Blocks). Each oddball block consisted of 1000-Hz and 1500-Hz standards and 400-Hz targets. During tetanic conditioning, 1000-Hz tones were presented at 11 Hz for 2.4 min. We analyzed the standard trials, comparing the ERPs evoked by the tetanized stimuli (1000 Hz tones: TS ) and untetanized stimuli (1500 Hz tones: TS–) in the Post Blocks with ERPs from the Pre Blocks (averaged into Baseline ERPs).**Results**: In Post Block 1 in HC, TS  tones evoked a negative shift (60–350 msec) at right temporal electrodes relative to Baseline. No pre-/post-tetanus effects were found in SZ. In Post Block 2 in HC, TS  tones evoked a positive shift (200–300 msec) at bilateral frontal electrodes. In SZ, TS  tones evoked a positive shift (100 – 400 msec) at right frontotemporal electrodes. No pre-/post-tetanus effects were found in either subject group for the TS– tones. The right temporal Post Block 1 and 2 effects were correlated in SZ, suggesting a trade-off in the expression of these effects.**Conclusions**: These results suggest that stimulus-specific auditory neuroplasticity is abnormal in schizophrenia. The electrophysiologic assessment of stimulus-specific plasticity may yield novel targets for drug treatment in schizophrenia."
abstract_short = "This paper was a human clinical electrophysiology investigation of rapid neuroplasticity in the laboratory setting, and the paper was published in Biological Psychiatry. The approach was a direct clinical translation of prior studies of human and animal model studies. The plasticity approach was the first clinical paper to adapt a translational human and animal biomarker for ERP measured auditory plasticity. As the first of its kind regarding disrupted neuroplasticity in schizophrenia it was part of a special issue, titled “Translational Neuroscience Insights into Neuroplasticity Deficits in Schizophrenia”. In the special issue reviews and experimental findings of animal & human clinical results were published side by side. Disrupted neuroplasticity may be an important aspect of the neural basis for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We utilized a paradigm that had previously been shown to be non- invasively measurable human subjects. The neuroplasticity paradigm had been demonstrated to correspond to several mechanisms responsible to NMDA mediated long-term potentiation in sensory pathways. In this investigation event-related brain potentials were used to assay neuroplasticity after auditory conditioning in chronic schizophrenia patients and matched healthy control subjects."
