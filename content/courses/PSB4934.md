Conscious awareness is a hallmark of human experience. In this class we will consider cutting edge research of brain mechanisms and neural signs as we discuss abnormal, altered, disrupted, and non-human consciousness. As a result of this class, we will have a better understanding of the potential function of consciousness and be able to differentiate conscious from unconscious processes.

**Relevant topics will include**:  
&#8226; *anesthesia*  &#8226; *coma*  &#8226; *dreams*  
&#8226; *free-will*  &#8226; *hallucinations*    
&#8226; *hallucinogens*  &#8226; *illusions*  
&#8226; *imagination*  &#8226; *sleep* 

**Date & Time**:

- Tuesday, 1:55 - 2:45 PM (7th period)
- Thursday, 1:55 - ***3:50*** PM (***7-8*** periods)
